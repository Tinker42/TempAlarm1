# TempAlarm1
An app that enables users to have alarms to go off at set temperatures

Android app that allows a user to schedule alarms to specific temperatures by their ZIP Code.
It would notify a user when temperatures fall below or exceed their specified temperatures by regularly comparing them to retrieved temps for their ZIP Code.
This helps protect against unnoticed changes in temperatures to prevent hypothermia, heat stroke, and energy inefficient household drafts.
I will also attempt to add functionality for notification and recommended action for emergencies derived from the OpenFEMA API.
