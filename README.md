# TempAlarm1
An app that enables users to have alarms to go off at set temperatures

Android app that allows a user to schedule alarms to specific temperatures by their ZIP Code or GPS location.
It would notify a user when temperatures fall below or exceed their specified temperatures by regularly comparing them to retrieved temps for their ZIP Code or GPS Location.
This helps protect against unnoticed changes in temperatures to prevent hypothermia, heat stroke, and energy inefficient household drafts.
The user can also set active times for the app stay alert and inactive times for the app to not disturb the user.
I hope to add warnings for emergencies and a Celsius option.
